We organize more professional development initiatives than any other  campus organization, giving our brothers an advantage in competitive career  opportunities. By emphasizing a balance between brotherhood and professionalism,  our brothers find an unrivaled community of driven individuals who motivate each  other to succeed.

Pledging is an intensive  five week process designed to help our pledges grow professionally and  personally. The time commitment for pledging can be compared to a part-time  internship. Pledges learn and exercise team-building, public speaking, and  leadership skills – all in the context of business projects and practices.  In addition, pledges will learn about the Fraternity’s history and operational  requirements through the planning and participation in projects and events.  Pledges are paired with big brothers in the chapter for additional mentorship  and professional growth. At the end of pledging, pledges are considered for  initiation into the Fraternity.
