Pledges learn and exercise team-building, public speaking, and \r\n          leadership skills – all in the context of business projects and practices. \r\n          In addition, pledges will learn about the Fraternity’s history and operational \r\n          requirements through the planning and participation in projects and events. \r\n          Pledges are paired with big brothers in the chapter for additional mentorship \r\n          and professional growth. At the end of pledging, pledges are considered for \r\n          initiation into the Fraternity.
