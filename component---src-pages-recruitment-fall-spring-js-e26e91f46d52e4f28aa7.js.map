The time commitment for pledging can be compared to a part-time \r\n          internship. Pledges learn and exercise team-building, public speaking, and \r\n          leadership skills – all in the context of business projects and practices. \r\n          In addition, pledges will learn about the Fraternity’s history and operational \r\n          requirements through the planning and participation in projects and events. \r\n          Pledges are paired with big brothers in the chapter for additional mentorship \r\n          and professional growth. At the end of pledging, pledges are considered for \r\n          initiation into the Fraternity. Although difficult, pledging is designed to \r\n          build the highest caliber of brotherhood and professionalism.\r\n        \"\r\n      />\r\n      <Accordion\r\n        title=\"If I do not get an invitation to pledge the first time, can I apply again?\"\r\n        content=\"\r\n          If you have grown personally and professionally since your last\r\n          recruitment process, you have an advantage over those students going\r\n          through the recruitment process for the first time and are welcome to\r\n          apply again.\r\n        \"\r\n      />\r\n      <Accordion\r\n        title=\"What criteria is used when deciding whom is given an invitation to\r\n        pledge?\"\r\n        content=\"\r\n          There is no pre-set image of the ideal candidate as we recognize the\r\n          different contributions that various individuals can make.
