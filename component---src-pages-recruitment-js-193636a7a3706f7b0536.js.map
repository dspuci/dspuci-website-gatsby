Interviews \n          are held at the end of the two weeks and select prospective members are then \n          given an invitation to pledge for the Fraternity. \n        \"\n      />\n      <Accordion\n        title=\"What sets Delta Sigma Pi apart from other business fraternities?\"\n        content=\"\n          We are the only business fraternity at UC Irvine to restrict membership to \n          business school majors, which is instrumental to our career \n          focus and tight-knit brotherhood. As the oldest business fraternity on campus, \n          we have the largest alumni network in every industry for our brothers to connect \n          with. We organize more professional development initiatives than any other \n          campus organization, giving our brothers an advantage in competitive career \n          opportunities. By emphasizing a balance between brotherhood and professionalism, \n          our brothers find an unrivaled community of driven individuals who motivate each \n          other to succeed.

Pledging is an intensive \n          five week process designed to help our pledges grow professionally and \n          personally. The time commitment for pledging can be compared to a part-time \n          internship. Pledges learn and exercise team-building, public speaking, and \n          leadership skills – all in the context of business projects and practices. \n          In addition, pledges will learn about the Fraternity’s history and operational \n          requirements through the planning and participation in projects and events. \n          Pledges are paired with big brothers in the chapter for additional mentorship \n          and professional growth. At the end of pledging, pledges are considered for \n          initiation into the Fraternity.
