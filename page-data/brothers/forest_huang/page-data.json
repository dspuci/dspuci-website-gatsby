I’m Forest Huang and I initiated fall of my freshman year as part of the Alpha Mu class. My favorite pastimes include hanging out with friends, trying new foods/restaurants, and playing/watching Esports. A fun fact about me is that I’ve been to two three Michelin starred restaurants (technically 3 if you count takeout). Ask me about video games, stocks, or anything else during recruitment!
