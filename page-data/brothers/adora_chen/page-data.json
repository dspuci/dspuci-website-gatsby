My name is Adora Chen, and I initiated during the spring of my first year with the Alpha Nu class. In my free time, I like to draw, cook, play card games with my friends, and visit fun dessert spots. A fun fact about me is that I used to have a music show for UCI's radio station. Ask me about anything at recruitment :)"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adora_chen"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
