My name is Aayush Shah and I initiated in the fall of my freshmen year, 2019, with the Alpha Iota Class! When I have some free time on my hands, I love to play Spikeball, listen to Country Music, and spend time with friends. A quick fun fact about me, I've actually eaten the spiciest pepper in the world the Carolina Reaper(I ate the whole thing!). Feel free to ask me if I think there is life on other planets at recruitment, I look forward to meeting you!"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aayush_shah"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
