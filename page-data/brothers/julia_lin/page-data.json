My name is Julia Lin and I initiated in the fall quarter of my Freshman year with the Alpha Mu class. In my free time, I like to read, travel, and find new shows/movies to watch. Some fun facts about me are that I have my own Lululemon e-commerce business, I've never had a marshmallow before, and I'm also a Canadian Dual-Citizen! Feel free to ask me about anything at recruitment whether it's about the favorite places I've traveled to or about my dog Princess :-)"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"julia_lin"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
