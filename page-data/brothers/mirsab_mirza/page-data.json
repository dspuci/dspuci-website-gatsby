My name is Mirsab and I initiated in Fall 2022 with the Alpha Xi class. I have an extreme passion for sports but if I’m not playing soccer or cricket, you can probably find me selling Funko Pops as part of a side business! Learning about other cultures through language, music, and food is one of my favorite hobbies and I can’t wait to learn about yours during recruitment!
