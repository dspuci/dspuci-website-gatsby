I'm Grace and I initiated in fall quarter of 2018 with the Alpha Eta class. When I have free time, I'm usually trying new recipes, finding new music on Soundcloud, or adventuring in search of new food/coffee/views. A fun fact about me is that my a capella group in high school sang the National Anthem at a Warriors game. Ask me about my puppy or the places I've traveled to at recruitment :\")"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"grace_hsiang"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
