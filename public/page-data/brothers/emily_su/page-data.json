I’m Emily and I initiated with the Alpha Theta class during Spring 2019 as a first year. In my free time, I love watching TV shows and movies, finding new music to make playlists on Spotify, and organizing my life in lists. At recruitment, feel free to ask me about some of my previous internship and volunteer experiences, academic and career planning, movie/show recommendations, or places to explore in the Bay Area (I’d also love to hear your recommendations for travel, music, and movies/shows)!"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"emily_su"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
