      <Accordion
        title="What is recruitment?"
        content="
          Recruitment is a series of events over two weeks to allow prospective members 
          the opportunity to learn more about Delta Sigma Pi. In turn, our collegiate 
          brothers will be able to learn more about the interested candidates as well. 
          Each event will highlight an aspect of our brotherhood and professionalism 
          such as a game night, alumni panel and professionalism workshop. Interviews 
          are held at the end of the two weeks and select prospective members are then 
          given an invitation to pledge for the Fraternity.

        title="What sets Delta Sigma Pi apart from other business fraternities?"
        content="
          We are the only business fraternity at UC Irvine to restrict membership to 
          business and technology related majors, which is instrumental to our career 
          focus and tight-knit brotherhood. As the oldest business fraternity on campus, 
          we have the largest alumni network in every industry for our brothers to connect 
          with. We organize more professional development initiatives than any other 
          campus organization, giving our brothers an advantage in competitive career 
          opportunities. By emphasizing a balance between brotherhood and professionalism, 
          our brothers find an unrivaled community of driven individuals who motivate each 
          other to succeed. However, what truly makes Delta Sigma Pi unrivaled is our drive 
          to make an impact on our communities and the world at large, which is something 
          unique to each brother. Talk to our brothers to find out more about the impact 
          they’ve made and what they hope to achieve.

        title="What is pledging?"
        content="
          After recruitment events and interviews, we extend invitations to select 
          prospective members for our pledging program. Pledging is an intensive 
          five week process designed to help our pledges grow professionally and 
          personally. The time commitment for pledging can be compared to a part-time 
          internship. Pledges learn and exercise team-building, public speaking, and 
          leadership skills – all in the context of business projects and practices. 
          In addition, pledges will learn about the Fraternity’s history and operational 
          requirements through the planning and participation in projects and events. 
          Pledges are paired with big brothers in the chapter for additional mentorship 
          and professional growth. At the end of pledging, pledges are considered for 
          initiation into the Fraternity. Although difficult, pledging is designed to 
          build the highest caliber of brotherhood and professionalism.

          There is no pre-set image of the ideal candidate as we recognize the
          different contributions that various individuals can make. However, we
          are still looking for highly motivated scholars that not only work
          well independently, but within a group as well. Potential, as well as
          present qualities, is a determining factor in the selection process.
          Some factors we take into consideration are professional aptitude,
          past successes, willingness to learn, passion, and social
          compatibility.
