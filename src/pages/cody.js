    <h1>Cody's Big Idea</h1>
    <p>This is Cody's process for creating the next big thing.</p>
    <h2>Ideation Phase</h2>
    <p>
      This is where Cody sits down and comes up with something that no one would
      have ever thought was possible. He sits there for hours and ruminates
      about stuff that mostly doesn't matter. Then, Eureka!
    </p>
    <h2>Design Phase</h2>
    <p>
      During this phase Cody carefully plans out his course of action in order
      to be able to perfectly carry out his fresh new idea.
    </p>
    <h2>Prototype Phase</h2>
    <p>
      In order to convince investors Cody must first build a Prototype, a rough
      draft if you will, of his designs from which investors will be able to
      understand his unique vision.
    </p>
    <h3>Part I</h3>
    <p>
      So the prototype phase actually has two parts. In the first part the
      prototype is purely visual and mostly nonfunctional. This is just to show
      others how the device intends to operate.
    </p>
    <h3>Part II</h3>
    <p>
      During the second part of the prototype phase Cody will actually set out
      to create a functional, albeit largely incomplete, version of his project
      in order to demonstrate the feasability of his great new idea.
    </p>
    <h2>Development Phase</h2>
    <p>
      This is a long phase where a team is assembled to actually develop a
      full-fledged version of the product from the ground up. The designs
      created in the design phase are referenced and amended to create the
      perfect version of the product.
