        “College is a turbulent time filled with excitement, uncertainty, and most 
        importantly opportunity. Delta Sigma Pi has enabled me to make the most of 
        my time at UCI, by being the one constant that I can always rely on. It has 
        been a source of laughter, support, and growth that gives me the faith to just 
        leap into the unknown without worrying about where I will land.

        <br />
        <br />
        Everyone has heard that “growth comes from discomfort”. But what is often 
        overlooked is that you don’t need to face the discomfort alone. I’m fortunate 
        to be surrounded by people who expect the best from me and are constantly 
        pushing to be better themselves. I know that I can trust these people to be by 
        my side, no matter whether I want to learn a new sport, prepare for interviews, 
        take part in a competition, or just go on a spontaneous adventure! They make the 
        difference between overcoming or succumbing.

        <br />
        <br />
        My experience in Delta Sigma Pi has been incredibly special and I’m excited to 
        see the chapter continue to grow. I hope that you will join us at our Spring 
        recruitment and see what makes this community special for yourself. Taking the 
        first step can be hard, but once you do, the possibilities are endless. I look 
        forward to welcoming you into our home away from home.

        <br />
        <br />
        See you soon :)

        <br />
        <br />
        Sincerely,

        <br />
