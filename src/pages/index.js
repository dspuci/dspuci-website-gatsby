        Dear Prospective Member,
        <br />
        <br />
        Life is full of surprises, especially in college. It can be a bit scary, but you
        don't have to go through it alone. During my time at UCI, Delta Sigma Pi has been
        like a family to me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Joining Delta Sigma Pi in my first year changed my life. The support and
        encouragement from everyone in the chapter has immensely fostered my growth both
        personally and professionally. We learn a lot from each other, and we want to share
        that knowledge with you too. Looking back on my three years here, it's been a mix of
        ups and downs, but I've had some of the best moments because of this chapter and met
        some of my best friends. The brothers in this chapter are some of my closest friends,
        mentors, and supporters. I wouldn’t be where I am today without this chapter and I am
        incredibly lucky to have found such a supportive and inspiring community to be a part
        of throughout college.



        <br />
        <br />
        Back when I was a freshman, I had no idea what I could achieve. Now, I'm truly excited
        and honored to serve as Delta Sigma Pi’s President and meet all of you at the upcoming
        Spring recruitment.
        <br />
        <br />

        I hope as you go through recruitment and meet all of us, you'll see what Delta Sigma Pi
        is all about. Being a part of this brotherhood is about so much more than just professional
        development. It’s about inspiring leadership on and off campus, being the first to have the
        courage and grit to break into the most challenging industries and companies, giving back
        to our communities, supporting one another to reach our ambitions in both professional and
        personal aspects, mentoring the next generation of leaders, and so much more. I’m so
        incredibly grateful to be able to host this Spring’s recruitment — excited to meet all of
        you and see where this journey takes you!

        <br />
        <br />
        Fraternally,

        <br />
        <br />
