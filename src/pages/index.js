        Three years ago, coming into UC Irvine as a Business Administration major, I had questions on my career path and even what my college experience was going to look like. Seeking answers, I started looking for a high-achieving business community on campus, which brought me to Delta Sigma Pi’s Fall 2017 Recruitment – and I never looked back. Today, I’m humbled and proud to be able to consider the brothers in this chapter as my closest friends, greatest supporters, career mentors, and family.
        <br/><br/>

        Over the years, I’ve seen firsthand the work and dedication that keeps this organization in a tier of its own. There’s no secret to our track record of achievement – if you talk to our brothers, you’ll quickly understand that our fraternal brotherhood is the common denominator in our career success. When I initiated, older brothers would always take time out of their schedule to walk me through a mock interview or fix up my resume before internship season. Every brother was a text or call away, like brothers before them had been. This continuous cycle of mentorship, sacrifice, and support is at the core of our unrivaled career success and fraternal legacy.
        <br/><br/>
        Professional achievement aside, our chapter is home to an incredibly diverse group of students – different identities, hometowns, music tastes – but one thing stays consistent. Ask any brother why he or she decided to join Delta Sigma Pi, and the response will be, “The people.” Genuine compassion, empathy, and humor keep us together, even when we’re apart. Between the boba runs, Disneyland trips, and even traveling the world together, the lifelong memories and friendships built between our brothers make Delta Sigma Pi much more than just any other organization.
        <br/><br/>
        Three years ago, I took the first step to attend recruitment, and my journey since then has exceeded all expectations. I strongly encourage you to take the first step as well – attend our upcoming recruitment events and learn more about becoming a part of our Fraternity.
        <br/><br/>
        Sincerely,
        <br/><br/>
        Henry Wang
        <br/><br/>
        President, Pi Sigma Chapter
