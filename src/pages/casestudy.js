        <div>
          You are to assume the role of a consultant working for your client,
          ANTEATER HOTELS, a moderately priced hotel chain with properties
          across the country. The C-Suite of the company (judges) has asked you
          to create marketing strategies and recommend operational changes that
          focus on teenagers and young adults as the target market.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          ANTEATER HOTELS has over 1,500 properties across the United States.
          Each ANTEATER HOTEL location boasts full-service restaurants, spa and
          fitness centers, and pools with playground areas along with
          beautifully appointed guest rooms and suites. The company has the
          highest rating in overall customer service and is in tight competition
          with its closest competitor for most rewards club members. While
          business isn’t hurting, the C-Suite (judges) feels that more attention
          needs to be focused on expanding brand loyalty, especially to
          teenagers (age 13-18) and young adults (age 18-25). Company data also
          shows that young adults make up the smallest portion of their rewards
          club members.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          ANTEATER HOTELS is interested in hearing about effective marketing
          strategies that can draw in teenagers and young adults to their
          hotels. Your client is also interested in operational changes to
          restaurants, fitness centers, and other amenities offered. Lastly,
          touch upon how the rewards program can be modified to appeal to young
          adults. The C-Suite (judges) will begin the role-play by greeting you
          and asking to hear your ideas. After you have presented your
          strategies and have answered their questions, the C-Suite (judges)
          will conclude by thanking you for your work and breaking character to
          go into feedback/discussion of the case.
