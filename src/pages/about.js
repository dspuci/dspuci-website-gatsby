        Delta Sigma Pi was founded on November 7, 1907 by four business students
        at New York University who saw an opportunity to impact the lives of
        their fellow business students. In 1975, Delta Sigma Pi officially
        became the nation's first co-ed business fraternity. Today, we have over
        300 collegiate chapters and over 290,000 initiated members worldwide.
        <br />
        <br />
        As the oldest business fraternity at UC Irvine, the Pi Sigma Chapter of
        Delta Sigma Pi has championed professionalism and a lifetime of
        opportunity for our members since 2008. We are the only fraternity on
        campus to restrict membership to business school majors, which is
        instrumental to our unrivaled career success and lifelong brotherhood.
        Over a decade later, our chapter has become the premier business
        fraternity on campus, unparalleled in our professional success and
        brotherhood.
