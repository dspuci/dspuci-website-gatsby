    <h1>Delta Sigma Pi History</h1>
    <p>
      Delta Sigma Pi is a co-ed professional fraternity organized to foster the
      study of business in universities; to encourage scholarship, social
      activity and the association of students for their mutual advancement by
      research and practice; to promote closer affiliation between the
      commercial world and students of commerce, and to further a higher
      standard of commercial ethics and culture and the civic and commercial
      welfare of the community. Delta Sigma Piâ€™s four founding members are
      Alexander Frank Makay, Henry Albert Tienken, Harold Valentine Jacobs, and
      Alfred Moysello, all of which were students at New York University. Delta
      Sigma Pi was founded on November 7, 1907, and has since initiated over
      265,000 brothers worldwide. There are currently over 220 active collegiate
      chapters, with many more alumni chapters, which continue to bring pride to
      the name Delta Sigma Pi. While every brother in Delta Sigma Pi is
      significant in his or her own way, some notable Deltasigs include S.
      Truett Cathy, the Founder and Chairman of Chick-fil-A, Fordon Bethune,
      Chairman and CEO of Continental Airlines and Henry W. Bloch, Honorary
      Chairman of H & R Block. However, the network of brothers in Delta Sigma
      Pi span far and wide from various industries, such as high technology
      start ups, to venture capitalists, to tax accountants to marketing
      managers. Our brothers do not only spread over America; there are
      Deltasigs all over the world and no matter where one may go, he or she
      will always find a brother there with him or her.{" "}

    <h1>Pi Sigma History</h1>
    <p>
      The Pi Sigma Chapter of the International Fraternity of Delta Sigma Pi is
      located at the University of California, Irvine, and was founded on May
      31, 2008. The Pi Sigma Chapter began because Adam Su and Myles Sterett saw
      a need within the UC Irvine community for a fraternity that focused on
      growing others professionally and fostering a sense of brotherhood. Nearly
      a decade later, Pi Sigma is intent on maintaining those two goals, and
      have since won a multitude of regional, provincial and national awards for
      our professional activities, community service and alumni relations. From
      our humble beginnings as the Sigma Beta Iota colony to now being the Pi
      Sigma Chapter, we have always been dedicated to hosting a myriad of
      professional, community service and social events in order to further our
      professionalism, dedication to helping the community and our sense of
      brotherhood. As of fall 2017, we have a total of 257 brothers who have
      entered Delta Sigma Pi through pledging with the Sigma Beta Iota colony
      and Pi Sigma Chapter. Being the three time winner of the National
      Outstanding Professional Events award (2011, 2012 & 2014), the Pi Sigma
      Chapter is unparalleled in terms of professionalism. Our professional
      events range from recruitment for Big 4, hotel management tours, speakers,
      consultation services, tech company tours, as so on. Since our network
      encompasses brothers from all around the world in a variety of industries,
      no matter your interest, you will find another brother who will be able to
      help you develop professionally and get a job. Our alumni network also
      continues to prove itself with the our chapter being the three time winner
      of the National Outstanding Alumni Relations award (2013, 2015 & 2017).
